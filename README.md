BUSINESS SALES DASHBOARD FROM  E-COMMERCE DATA

This project looks at online shopping sales data. The goal is to make easy-to-understand pictures (charts) using Power BI that show:
Which products sell the most?
When sales are highest in the year?
Which product groups or places make the most money?

This helps business owners see important information quickly and make good decisions.
